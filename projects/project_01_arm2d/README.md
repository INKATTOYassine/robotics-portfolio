# Project 01 — 2D Robotic Arm Simulator (Python)

## Objective
Develop a desktop application that simulates a planar 2-link robotic arm.
The application visualizes the arm configuration and computes its kinematics.

## Features (Planned)
- Forward kinematics (2-link planar arm)
- Interactive joint angle control
- 2D visualization
- Inverse kinematics (later phase)

## Technologies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyQt5 

## Status
Phase 1 — Environment and structure setup
